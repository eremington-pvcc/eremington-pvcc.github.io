  <h2>White Hat Hacking: A Summary.</h2>
  <h3><i><a href="sources.html">White hat hacking</a> is the act of penetrating computer security for the purposes of alerting the owner of the target machine or system to security exploits and vulnerabilities that a malicious hacker could use for personal gain. </i></h3>
  <p>The word “Hacker” may seem big and scary to the average person, and with good reason. It is often used to incite fear and a sense of dread, despite the average hacker simply being a very computer-savvy person who happens to know more about computer architecture and code than the average person. </p>
  <p>It should be noted that there are different terms for different types of hackers, those typically being “White Hat”, “Black Hat”, “Red Hat”, and “Gray Hat” hackers, each with their own motivations. A Black Hat hacker is what most people think of when someone talks about hackers. Black Hat hackers typically have the motivation to wreak as much havoc on a computer system as possible, usually for financial or personal gain, in many instances both.</p>
  <p>A <a href="sources.html">Red Hat</a> hacker is what one could call a vigilante in the computer world. Doing morally good work through typically malicious manners, such as the recent events of SiegedSec, a self-identified group of “gay furry hackers” hacking into the Heritage Foundation.</p>
  <p>Moving on to one more type of hacker to get a broad sense of the types of hackers out there, we have Gray Hat hackers. Gray Hat hackers are typically freelance hackers who like to poke at large computer systems’ security to test both their own skills and the security of their target system. Where White Hat hackers are typically employed by a company or government to test their own security, Gray Hat hackers often poke into these systems without permission, and more importantly without the idea of personal gain, for the purposes of notifying the system administrators and owners that their system is vulnerable.</p>
  <p>The average person will likely never encounter any of these hackers, at least as long as they are not attempting to access secure information on a public network, such as logging into your bank account while on a cafe’s public wifi. The idea that every single person on the planet needs a VPN is largely false, so long as you practice internet safety. In a <a href="sources.html"> Youtube short</a> by the channel Pirate Software, he explains that, to him, public networks are “PvP enabled networks”, which, to put it in layman terms, means no sensitive information should ever be accessed while on an unsecured network. </p>
  <p>The benefits of White Hat and Gray Hat hacking are that the system administrator(s) are able to find vulnerabilities in their systems and secure them accordingly. Nothing that has an internet connection is truly hacker-proof, but measures can be taken to make their job a hell of a lot more difficult. Furthermore, White Hat hacking is a job that pays incredibly well, as computerized threats become more and more sophisticated by the day, leading to more security being needed to access certain information. Unfortunately most of the websites that most people will use on a day-to-day basis will not be updated for the most recently discovered threat, and have a fair amount of vulnerabilities as it is. Most websites are set up with basic defenses with the intention to prevent service outages. </p>
  <p>The most secure systems will be closed-loop systems, like the computerized cash registers found in grocery stores or shopping malls, with incredibly small amounts of online traffic being allowed through, if any at all.</p>
  <p>So, on to the big question that has a complex answer: Is it the responsibility of an operating system/network to guard access to a computer, or is it the responsibility of a hacker to keep their nose out of it? The answer is a bit complicated. The everyday operating system or computer network should be secured against most threats, but the expectation that it will be 100% hacker-proof is delusional. </p>
  <p>A system owner should be aware of the security of their systems and should be brought up to speed on any vulnerabilities so that they can be mitigated or eliminated. Keep yourself safe out there, remember to always use <a href="sources.html">Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</a> when possible, and maybe do some White or Gray Hat hacking of your own. You might be surprised at what you might be able to do.</p>
